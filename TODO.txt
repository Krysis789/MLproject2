Problems to solve:

- last word from vocab is missing in cooc -> investigate teachers code in cooc.py
- tweets containing no word in vocab get represented with NaN weights, that are not supported by classifier (not a problem to drop in train, but missing prediction if it occurs in test)

Optimization to try:
- Try different kind of classifier, different parameters, etc.
- Custom tweet representation (cf Sevan's notes for ideas)

Organize notebook:
- clean up my mess :D



Ideas to improve the predictions : 

- Negations (puting "not" with the following word to form one word for instance)

- Plurals (separate words or not ??)

- Vocab/Grammar mistakes + letter repetitions ("I loooooove chocolate" = "I love chocolate")

- Get rid of some particular words (list of stop words, for instance "a", "the",... ??)

- Punctuation ???
